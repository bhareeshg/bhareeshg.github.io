<h2 style="color:blue">Mildly hierarchical triple systems</h2>
<p>
Dynamics of three body systems comprising of a closely separated binary and a distant companion (i.e., in a hierarchical configuration) is well studied in literature. Interactions between the binary and the companion are weak in such systems and deviations from the Keplerian orbit of the binary can be derived from the perturbation theory. When the mutual inclination between the binary and the companion is more than 400, the eccentricity of the binary and the mutual inclination can undergo large amplitude oscillations called von-Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov (vZLK) Mechanism. The eccentricity excitation allows the components of the binary to have close encounters which under certain conditions allows dissipative processes like tides in planetary systems and gravitational radiation in compact binaries to circularize and harden the binary. The dynamics is richer when the companion is on an eccentric orbit. It can lead to eccentricity excitation over wider parameter space, orbit flips and chaotic evolution.

In literature, secular dynamics of hierarchical triple systems are usually studied by truncating expansions of the interaction potential of the companion. While the truncation of the potential works well for hierarchical systems, it is inadequate for mildly hierarchical systems in which the companions are closer to the binaries. Hence, I developed a secular code which numerically evaluates the interaction potential, thereby removing the need to truncate it. A systematic study of mildly hierarchical systems using this code allowed me to delineate the regime where truncation methods are accurate and illustrate how the dynamics of mildly hierarchical systems differs from the dynamics of hierarchical systems.

I found that eccentricity excitation and orbital flips were more common in mildly hierarchical systems as compared to hierarchical systems. Using the surface of sections, I uncovered new secular resonances which can be important for mildly hierarchical systems. I also found that mildly hierarchical systems are more chaotic. Additionally, in triples in initially near-coplanar configurations, I found that eccentricity excitation and orbital flips are more common in configurations in which the perturber is initially anti-aligned with the test particle. This is consistent with earlier results on hierarchical systems. I also derived limit on the mass of the perturber below which the secular approximation is valid.

Finally, I applied my results to study the secular effects of a hypothetical planet (Planet-9) in the outer solar system on the population of extreme Trans-Neptunian objects. The Planet-9 hypothesis has been invoked to explain clustering in the orientation of eTNOs. Using an ensemble of N-body simulations I showed that clustered eTNOs do occupy the resonant regions I found in the surface of sections evaluated using our secular code. In addition, I found that near polar Planet-9 configurations can also reproduce clustering but lead to wider spread in the eTNO inclinations. Future observations can help us better constrain the inclination of Planet-9.

<h2 style="color:blue"> Blackhole mergers through Precession Induced Resonances </h2>
<p>
Recent detections of gravitational waves  provided unprecedented opportunity to study evolution of black hole binary mergers. Multiple merger pathways have been proposed to account for the current census of gravitational wave events. For instance, it has been suggested that AGN (Active Galactic Nucleus) discs are important sources of gravitational waves. AGN discs and the surrounding nuclear star clusters are dense with stars and compact objects. This allows compact binaries to form in-situ in the AGN disc or be captured by the disc. Once embedded in an AGN disc, a wide variety of processes can aid in the merger of compact binaries. Gravitational torques from the gas in the disc as well as flybys can harden binaries to the point where gravitational radiation becomes dominant resulting in a quick merger. 
</p>
<p>
I proposed a new mechanism which can aid in the mergers of binary compact objects in AGN disc inspired from planetary dynamics. It was shown that the moon in its early evolution could have been trapped in evection resonance (a type of precession-induced resonance) induced by sun, allowing the transfer of angular momentum from earth-moon orbit to earth-sun orbit. For black hole binaries in the AGN disk, they can be captured in precession induced resonances, when the orbital period of the supermassive blackhole is commensurable with the precession timescale of the binary.  Once captured, the binary eccentricity and inclination can be excited as it sweeps through the resonance. The maximum eccentricity depends on the resonance in which the binary is captured, as well as the inclination at which the binary is captured. For instance, the eccentricity of a coplanar binary captured in evection resonance can be excited to unity unless it is disrupted by the companion.  
</p>
<p>
The eccentricity excitation allows close encounters between the binary components, reducing the merger time of the binary. The resonance capture probability depends on the ratio of the libration timescale of the resonance and the migration timescale. A smaller ratio corresponds to the larger the capture probability. Also, the capture probability is nonzero only when the ratio is less than 0.1-0.01 depending on the mass of binary components and binary separation. Binaries coplanar with captured in evection resonance can merge on the migration timescale. I found that this mechanism can reduce the merger time by 3-5 orders of magnitude depending on the migration timescale.
